167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a target and list of numbers, find two numbers such that they sum up to the target
return the indexes+1 of the two numbers, i.e. return [index(num1)+1,index(num2)+1]
Approach:
Two pointers
First pointer at the start index and the Second pointer at the last
Since the given array is sorted if the target<arr[first]+arr[last]; then the value must be increased so the first pointer is increased i.e. +1 so that the next value will be greater than the previous oneand similarly if the sum exceeds target then the second pointer is decremented
Code:
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        first = 0
        last = len(numbers)-1
        ans = []
        while first<last:
            CurrentSum = numbers[first]+numbers[last]
            if CurrentSum<target:
                first += 1
            elif CurrentSum>target:
                last -= 1
            else:
                ans.append(first+1)
                ans.append(last+1)
                break
        return ans
