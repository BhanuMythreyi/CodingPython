1. Two Sum

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashMap = {}
        
        for i,n in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target-n
            if diff in hashMap:
                return [hashMap[diff],i]
            hashMap[n] = i
        return
# In the last line we dont have to return anything actually since it is provided that such pair exists for sure
