322. Coin Change

# Greedy Approach(Always choosing the coin with highest value and so on) did not work tried though

example to prove the above point
arr = [1,9,16] and target = 18
In Greedy we get 16+1+1 i.e. total number of coins = 3
instead of that if we chose 9+9 i.e. total number of coins = 2
So Greedy doesn't work always


So Use DP:Dynamic Programming / Optimization
