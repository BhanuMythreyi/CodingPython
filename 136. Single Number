136. Single Number

XOR approach is used
a^a = 0
a^0 = a
a^b = b^a

Given array contains numbers, All the numbers will be repeated twice and only 1 single number will be only once. Find that number
hence the approach is : a^b^a^c^b so answer = c; as a^a=0 and b^b =0 and then c^0 =c
Code:
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for num in nums:
            ans = ans^num
        return ans
